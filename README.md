# library-functions
Huge collection of library functions as recreated by yours truly

The school I go to forbids the use of non-original code. Because of this the first project for all new students is to create a library of standard functions of their own. This is my library. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

This library is included in all of the other projects you'll see on this github. All of the functions do an excellent job at recreating their standard counterparts- that being said however, many of them were written while I was still learning some basic programming concepts. This means that I am hesitant to share them publicly. They are, however, integral to the functionality of many of my projects, and as such must be submitted alongside them
